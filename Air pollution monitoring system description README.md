IOT based Air Pollution Monitoring System 

Arduino code is codded in C++ programming language. Arduino Uno is used as Arduino board for this model.
To build an air pollution monitoring system using Arduino, you will need the following components:

1. Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano)
2. Air quality sensor module (e.g., MQ-135, CCS811, BME680)
3. Jumper wires (male-to-male and male-to-female)
4. Breadboard or prototyping board
5. USB cable for Arduino board
6. Wi-Fi module (e.g., ESP8266) if you want to connect to the internet and send data to a cloud platform
7. Power supply (depends on the specific requirements of the components and setup)

Optional components (depending on your project requirements):

8. LCD display module for real-time data display
9. Buzzer or LED for audible/visual alerts
10. Enclosure or case for housing the system
11. Additional sensors for measuring specific gases or compounds (e.g., CO, NO2, O3)
